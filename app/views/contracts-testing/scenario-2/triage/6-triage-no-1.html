      <h1>Orders with a value less than £40k</h1>

      <p>For orders under £40k, you can execute a Direct Award procedure. This means you’re free to choose to procure any Catalogue Solution or service on the Buying Catalogue.</p>
      <p>Your contract value should include everything you intend to spend. </p>
<p>It would not, for example, be acceptable to execute a number of Direct Awards to the same supplier to avoid carrying out a competition.
</p>

      <p>You’ll not be ready to place an order of this value until you’ve browsed the Buying Catalogue and identified what you want.</p>
