<p><b>These are the typical processes and timescales to implement this Catalogue Solution:</b></p>
<p>We can deploy our solutions as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 CCG area in week 1</li>
  <li>3 CCG areas in week 2</li>
  <li>3 CCG areas in week 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Each practice will be provided with all the training, necessary to help deliver the service. Support will be available to all practices between the core working hours of 9:00am â€“ 5.00pm, recognising the pressing and urgent needs currently pressed by COVID-19.</p>
<p>We will provide off-site remote training for practices, coupled with online training videos to access any time.</p>
<p>We will provide 1st Line tech support and 2nd Line patient support.</p>
<p>All staff at ADDVantage Technologies have the ability to answer any questions that the practices may have. We will provide training to help all staff make use of the solution as easy as possible.</p>
<p>The technology has an in-built chat system and in-app messaging function.</p>
<p>We have already deployed remote working across our on-shore and off-shore teams to ensure services will be maintained and patient access will remain disruption free.</p>
