          <h2>
            Browse Solutions - Starting a competition
          </h2>

          <h4>When you’re ready to start a procurement, you can use the Buying Catalogue to search for Catalogue Solutions that meet your requirements.</h4>

          <p>You can search the Buying Catalogue and find out more about Catalogue Solutions as part of pre-procurement research. This will help you think about your requirements (the Capabilities and Epics) and how you will evaluate the services you take into your competition.</p>

          <p>You will be able to save the search results as part of the audit trail evidencing how you chose the Solutions that would be involved in the competition.</p>

          <p>When you search for a Catalogue Foundation Solution Set, you must take all of the Catalogue Solutions in your results into your competition.</p>

          <p>When you search using the Capabilities, the Buying Catalogue results may not be as exact as when you search for a Catalogue Foundation Solution Set. If your search results have Catalogue Solutions that aren’t relevant to your requirement, you are able to remove them from your list. However, you must only deselect Catalogue Solutions that don’t meet your requirement and you also must justify why the Catalogue Solution is being removed. It is up to you to make sure your competition is fair. There is more information about this in the Buyer’s Guide [link to guidance page when its available].</p>
