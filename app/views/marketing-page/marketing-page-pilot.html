    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Caltech Web is the most widely used GP clinical system in the UK. Created by clinicians for clinicians, it helps run efficient practices, whilst delivering the best possible patient care. With patient safety at its core, Caltech Web enables you to deliver safe &amp; informed on-demand care across locations.</p>

    <h2>Full description</h2>

    <p>We’re the UK leader in connected healthcare software and services. Through innovative IT we help healthcare professionals access the information they need to provide better, faster and more cost effective patient care.</p>
    <p>This all came from one idea shared by two GPs: that technology can be used to give clinicians access to complete and shared medical records, no matter where patients present for care.</p>
    <p>Our clinical software is now used in all major healthcare settings from GP surgeries to pharmacies, hospitals, and specialist community services. By providing innovative, integrated solutions, we’re working to break the boundaries of system integration and interoperability.</p>
    <p>For over 30 years, we’ve been working to ensure that healthcare professionals across the NHS have all the information they need by providing them with instant access to electronic patient records. We support this by supplying IT infrastructure and engineering services to enhance these systems.</p>
