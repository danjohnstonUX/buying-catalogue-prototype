      <hr>
      <p class="nhsuk-heading-s">Subject matter of the processing</p>
      <p>The subject-matter of processing of personal data by the Processor is
        the provision of the Service to the Controller that involves the
        processing of personal data. Personal data will be subject to those
        processing activities which are for the purposes of providing you with
        healthcare and medical services and/or information relating to support
        relevant to you and to comply with a legal obligation and to fulfil a
        contractual obligation that we have with you.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-heading-s">Duration the processing</p>
      <p>The Processing will take place over the duration of the relevant
        Service. The storage of any data item that contains detail of either
        system or practice operational information, that may require retention
        for purposes of historical review or audit, shall be retained for a period
        which is no longer than is necessary for those purposes, as instructed
        by the Service Recipients in their capacity as Controllers.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-heading-s">Nature and purposes of processing</p>
      <p>For a Patient/Service User
        Patient/Service Users can receive support relating to their healthcare concerns
        when a Video and Online Consultation is the most appropriate method for
        delivering that support
        For Health or Care Professional
        Health or Care Professionals can conduct consultations remotely over video and
        online ensuring care services can be delivered in a personal way regardless of
        location
        For Healthcare Organisation
        Increase Patient/Service User access to advice or consultation by removing the
        barrier of locality.
        All Processing is conducted in the United Kingdom.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-heading-s">Types of personal data</p>
      <p>Patients/Patients' representatives/guardians: contact details
        First Name
        Last Name
        Gender
        Password
        Email address</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-heading-s">Categories of data subjects</p>
      <p>Application and Platform and website Users. Patients, Patients'
        representatives/guardians, Practice/Service Users, persons working within the
        wider NHS and social care system. Staff (including volunteers, agents, and
        temporary workers), customers/ clients, suppliers, patients, students / pupils,
        members of the public and public bodies as required by Law.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-heading-s">Plan for return and destruction of the data once the processing is complete</p>
      <p>Electronic patient records can't be destroyed or deleted for the foreseeable future.
        Paper: paper records are destroyed to an international standard and the
        organisation has an agreement in place with a third party organisation for collecting
        shredded waste (Shredit) They are shredded (using a cross cut shredder) under
        confidential conditions.</p>
