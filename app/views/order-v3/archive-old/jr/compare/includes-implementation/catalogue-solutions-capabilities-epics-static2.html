<p><b>These are the typical processes and timescales to implement this Catalogue Solution:</b></p>
<p>Our accelerated mobilisation process involves a deployment window of 1-2 days per practice or PCN. Hundreds of sites have been set-up during the pandemic on this individual timescale. The system, co-designed with end clinical users, is intuitive with a ‘plug-and-play’ approach.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the COVID-19 response, we have moved to a video-led training model, with daily ‘drop in’ webinar sessions for Q&A with the named contact. This applies for both COVID-19 vaccination appointments and for video consultation.</li>
  <li>Named contact initially gets in touch, sets-up key users, and gives access to our training area (training videos/handbooks), and confirms technical set-up using our automated test page. Drop in sessions are provided daily for Q&A.</li>
  <li>Implementation is supported with Live Chat functionality (plus dynamic content access) for all users of the system (clinicians, receptionists, patients) 8am-8pm, 7 days a week. This has excellent feedback for responsiveness and interactive troubleshooting.</li>
